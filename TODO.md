# backlog

* Remove NERDTree once fully OK with netrw
* Assess pandoc

  - brew leaves - report what's been explicitly installed (over and above
    dotfiles), suggest what packages should be removed / auto-prune option
* Can we store learnt spelling dictionary? And make available to all tools?
    ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary
* Pre-install plugins in vi (currently vi has to be started and :PlugUpdate run)
* Pre-run xcode-select --install
* Assess cmus
* If necessary execute npm install -g npm
* Change default shell to fish - currently done manually with
    `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish`

* assess neofetch
* Use includeIf to include git config per organisation / user profile
* Automate set up of caps lock as escape key
* Automatically load tmux plugins, currently need to do C-a I
* Get ta fish completion working, tmux a -t works, how do we register an alias
    for autocompletion
* gx glitched for me to open external URL - why?
* cheat for listing bind keys consider maping prefix [ ] to
    moving pane left right in tmux.  What about up / down?
* how to make the osx key mapping diff clearer to read, e.g. aligned with git
    diff-color
* Try COC code completion - vimrc configuration and CocInstall
* Auto  jenv enable-plugin maven
