* Assess pandoc
* Improve report tool (use python)
  - brew leaves - report what's been explicitly installed (over and above
    dotfiles), suggest what packages should be removed / auto-prune option
* Can we store learnt spelling dictionary? And make available to all tools?
  ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary
* Pre-install plugins in vi (currently vi has to be started and :PlugUpdate run)
* Pre-run xcode-select --install
* Create a way to report on any files not checked in any of my bookmarked places
   - z, fastd or autojump, z.lua
* Assess cmus
* If necessary execute npm install -g npm
* Change default shell to fish - currently done manually with
  `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish`
* Disable Mac OS auto correct keyboard -> text
* Try devicons https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons
* assess neofetch
* Use includeIf to include git config per organisation / user profile
* **Try NeoVim**
* Automate set up of caps lock as escape key
* Automatically load tmux plugins, currently need to do C-a I
* Get ta fish completion working, tmux a -t works, how do we register an alias
  for autocompletion
* Review fish key bindings - should Ctrl-b and Ctrl-f go back a word. Quite a
  common thing and Esc-b f is a pain
* Automate pip install - inc pip3 install --user pynvim for nvim deoplete
* Change <CR> mapping to perhaps shift+<CR> to make less likely to
  accidentally press
