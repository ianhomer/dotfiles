# todo

- [ ] Harden git synk when both incoming and outgoing - merge / merge conflict
- [ ] review whether I need omf anymore
- [ ] try vim-test
- [ ] try vim-themis
- [ ] Auto remote fix `git-remote-fix` when broken
- [ ] Change magnet shortcut for next previous screen to ,.
- [ ] Set up git synk to only synk if not recently synked - I do not rapidly
  switch between devices.
- [ ] If space f when focus on nerd tree then ensure file opened in main window
- [ ] Improve vim searching - e.g. search in files matching pattern, full screen
  search ... what other parametrisation makes sense.
