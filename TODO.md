    ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary
* Pre-install plugins in vi (currently vi has to be started and :PlugUpdate run)
* Pre-run xcode-select --install

* Change default shell to fish - currently done manually with
    `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish`

    right in tmux.  What about up / down?

    diff-color
