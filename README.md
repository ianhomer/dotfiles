# .dotfiles

Configure my computers - see thanks below for inspiration.

# tl;dr

    git clone git@github.com:ianhomer/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles/bin/dotme

After installed then update at any time with

    dotme

# Why?

This dotfiles configuration is based about my prefered way of working to
streamline distraction free coding. This includes:

* brew - package managerr
* fish - friendly interactive shell
* git - source control
* iterm - terminal
* vi - file editing

It is also useful if you install a windows manager, e.g. Magnet.
