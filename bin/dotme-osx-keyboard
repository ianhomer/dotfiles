# This script is experimental at the moment and not in the main dotme install
# process.
#
# To mature this script I need to address the following
# * Multiple keyboard layouts - export / import - programaticcally
# * how to make the osx key mapping diff clearer to read, e.g. aligned with git
#   diff-color.
# * Automate set up of caps lock as escape key
# * Create mechamism to test keyboard output so that I can customise keyboard
#   and learn how to remap keys.
